    "(For an extra challenge, write code which will repeatedly ask a user how tall they are and tell them whether or not they're tall enough to ride, until the user doesn't enter a height at all, in which case the program stops. Curious about how to do this? See the function tall_enough_extension() in the solution code!)"
